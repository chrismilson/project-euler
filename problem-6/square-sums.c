** The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
* 1^2 + 2^2 + ... + 10^2 = 385
*
* The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
* (1 + 2 + ... + 10)^2 = 55^2 = 3025
*
* Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural
* numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.
*
* Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred
* natural numbers and the square of the sum.
*
* Answer: 25164150.

/*
** We can use the closed form of both the sum of the first n natural
* numbers and the sum of the square of the first n natural numbers. Being
* n(n + 1)/2 and n(n + 1)(2n + 1)/6 respectively.
