Problem 39

If p is the perimeter of a right angle triangle with integral length sides,
{a,b,c}, there are exactly three solutions for p = 120.

{20,48,52}, {24,45,51}, {30,40,50}

For which value of p â‰¤ 1000, is the number of solutions maximised?

## Solution

We can generate all pythagorean triples a^2 + b^2 = c^2 uniquely as a function
of three integers; k, m, and n with Euclid's formula:

```
a = k * (m^2 - n^2), b = k * (2mn), c = k * (m^2 + n^2)
where m > n, m and n are coprime and not both odd.
```

Answer : 840
