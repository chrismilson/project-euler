# project-euler
A place to keep my answers to the project euler problems

If you want to run the program associated with a specific problem just do

```bash
  make 6
```

(or another number if you didnt want to run problem 6)

A lot of the problems have descriptions of the problem and my thinking behind
my solution in large block comments at the beginning of the source files.
