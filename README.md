# project-euler
A place to keep my answers to the [project euler](https://projecteuler.net/) problems

If you want to run the program associated with a specific problem just do

```bash
  make 6
```

(or another number if you didnt want to run problem 6)

A lot of the problems have descriptions of the problem and my thinking behind
my solution in large block comments at the beginning of the source files.



## tools

You can get tools for streamlining the creation of new problems by doing
```
git submodule update --init devtools
make tools
```
(If this is a really dodgy way of doing submodules please let me know)
